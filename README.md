# Syllabus scraper

#### DO NOT DELETE pdf folder

The scraper goes through a subaccount and looks through each course's 'Syllabus' tab and downloads all .pdf files present and renames each of them according to course code and year (into the pdf folder).

dl_data.csv tells you what files were downloaded for each course.
